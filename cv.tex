\section{Research Interests}

My research activities concern infinite dimensional optimization, control and mechanical systems theory, theoretical and numerical reinforcement learning and their applications to robust and optimal control. I am particularly interested in leveraging information from theoretical analysis of problems to design efficient numerical algorithms, mainly for a real-time computations of optimal strategies. During my Ph.D., I specialized in optimal control problems in aerospace such as endo/exo-atmospheric rendezvous and motion planning in aeronautics, and I also provided state-of-the-art C++ based softwares for fast predictions of missile interception missions. During my postdoc at the Department of Aeronautics \& Astronautics at Stanford University, I am focusing on several topics: theoretical and numerical developments for sequential convex programming, path-planning and human-robot interaction, Riemannian Motion Control Policy (RMCP) and reinforcement learning procedures. The main objective consists of computing robust optimal controls in real time for freeflyer systems and robotic manipulators. These algorithms will be tested on real challenging scenarios by NASA on the International Space Station (ISS), starting from September 2019. I have recently started to adapt such paradigms to solve different problems, such as, high-dimensional Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD). \\

\item \textbf{Applications:} real-time optimal control of launch vehicle systems involved in rendezvous problems, atmospheric reentry and satellite orbit transfert, real-time optimal control of freeflyer and robotic manipulators for sensitive operations on the ISS, fast computations of optimal solutions for massive AMoD problems.
