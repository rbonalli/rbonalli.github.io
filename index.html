			I am a tenured CNRS researcher at <a href="https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/" target="_blank">Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S)</a>, CentraleSupeléc and Université Paris-Saclay. Prior to joining L2S, I was Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="http://asl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL)</a> (Director <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/" target="_blank">Prof Marco Pavone</a>), Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics, Stanford University. I obtained a PhD in Applied Mathematics at Sorbonne Université under a collaboration between Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions (<a href="https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/trelat/" target="_blank">Prof Emmanuel Trélat</a>) and ONERA-The French Aerospace Lab (<a href="http://herisse.bruno.free.fr/page.php?part=publication&lang=en" target="_blank">Dr Bruno Hérissé</a>). I also received a MSc in Mathematical Engineering and a BSc in Physical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano.

			My research interests focus on optimal control with applications to robotics and aerospace systems. More specifically, I combine techniques from control and game theory, differential geometry and machine learning to design fast and theoretically guaranteed algorithms for the optimal control in real-time of complex autonomous robotic systems and launch vehicles. I am currently collaborating with NASA on the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee" target="_blank">Astrobee Project</a>, and with Facebook Robotics and Google Brain to design new robust reinforcement learning paradigms.

			The goal of my research is to devise algorithms for <em>autonomous systems</em> that balance <b>optimality</b> and <b>robustness</b> to select the best available strategy and make decisions under uncertainty in dynamic environments. My research philosophy promotes <em>mathematical investigation</em> into the nature of these problems alongside algorithmic design. By leveraging tools from optimal, geometric and stochastic control, differential geometry, optimization, statistical analysis, and machine learning, the goal is to reveal structure and insights to drive <b>major improvements</b> over existing algorithms and create <b>novel paradigms</b>. <!-- I am currently collaborating with <b>Facebook (FAIR)</b>. -->
